# prepimg
prepare images for publishing

opensource.com (OSDC) requires a maximum width for images to be 600 pixels. This script checks the width of a screenshot and reduces if needed.
the script also adds a 1 pixel black border to all screenshots. Screenshot names are prepended with "Ready" once processed.
